## Architecture

The app is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This design pattern separates the concerns of data, UI, and business logic, leading to a more modular and testable codebase. The app's architecture is further enhanced by GetX, a state management library that simplifies reactive programming and state transitions.

---

## State Management

State management is handled using the GetX library. The architecture separates the app into models, views, and view models, providing a reactive and efficient way to manage application state and update the UI.
